The profile page can serve as a place to put useful links for our repos etc 
[Here is how to do it](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile)
And here is an example of [GitHubs](https://github.com/github/.github/tree/main/profile) own profile organisation page

I think it would be most useful as a place to have the Style Guide, and also the plugins and any other onboarding and reference tools
Check out the [GitHub organisation repo](https://github.com/github/.github/tree/main) where they keep similar useful info
